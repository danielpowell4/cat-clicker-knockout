ud989-cat-clicker-ko-starter
============================

A more sophisticated, though perhaps less fun, version of [clicker cats](https://github.com/danielpowell4/clicker-cats), this project was built in the later stages of Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree program (ud989).

Leveraging the simple KnockoutJS library for binding, click data is stored in variables in the browser.

Toggling the cats' names at the top changes the active cat and thus what's being displayed and interacted with in the view.
